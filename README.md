In this repository, there are several notebooks. These notebooks are the models for Cassandra team's stock price prediction ddashboard and API. 

Some of the models are : 
* Simple Moving Average 
* TensorFlow LSTM Time Series Model

In the notebooks, the cell outputs can be seen. These models are also suitable for other datasets in finance domain. These are especially trained with stock datasets however we expect that they can also give predictions in the crypto domain
